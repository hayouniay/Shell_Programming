| **color.sh**    | Designed for sourcing into scripts; contains only those functions unlikely to need modification |

Usage

The following steps outline what's typically involved to help you get started:

1. Choose between using the scripting files and run it:
    1. `calcul.sh` with `color.sh` (source in most functions)
    2. `convert.sh` with `color.sh` (source in most functions)
    3. `factorial.sh` with `color.sh` (source in most functions)
2. Need to update the `main()` function to call all functions(non-standalone): to be developed
